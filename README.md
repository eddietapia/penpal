# penpal
PenPal Application to have volunteers become anonymous pen pals with people in prisons to increase their mental health.

### Inside this directory, you can run several commands:
  ```yarn start```<br>
  Starts the development server.<br><br>

  ```yarn build```<br>Bundles the app into static files for production.<br><br>

  ```yarn test```<br>Starts the test runner.<br><br>

  ```yarn eject```<br>Removes this tool and copies build dependencies, configuration files
    and scripts into the app directory. If you do this, you canâ€™t go back!<br><br>
<br><br>
I suggest that you begin by typing:<br>
  ```
  cd penpal
  yarn start
  ```
